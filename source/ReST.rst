Titles are under- (and over-)lined (decorated) by ``=*-^"~`:.'#`` as below.  The
exact order of the decoration is not important, the one below is the
`Python convention <http://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html#sections>`_.

Normal paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

A ``=`` with overlines is very often preferred to a ``*`` with
overlines for chapters. The previously quoted
`Python development guide
<http://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html#sections>`_ while
advising to use stars uses internally equal character.

`Docutils documentation <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ uses
overlined ``=`` for parts, overlined ``-`` for chapters, ``=`` for
sections, ``-`` for subsections, back quotes (`) for subsubsections.

Transition
----------
Any repetition of 4 or more punctuation characters with preceding and trailing
blank line is a transition, and looks like this:

----

.. index::
   emphasize
   strong
   code
   inline markup
   inline markup; strong
   inline markup; emphasize
   inline markup; code

.. _rest_inline_markup:

```don't know```            `don't know`

See :restref:`inline markup reference

..  _rest_roles:

ReStructuredText Text Roles.
----------------------------

The :restref:`ReStructuredText Interpreted Text Roles <roles.html>`
are valid both for reST and Sphinx processing.  They are:
``:emphasis:``, ``:strong:``, ``:literal:``, ``:code:``, ``:math:``,
``:pep-reference:``, ``:rfc-reference:``, ``:subscript:``,
``:superscript:``, ``:title-reference:``, ``:raw:``. The first three
are seldom used because we prefer the shortcuts provided by previous
:ref:`reST inline markup <rest_inline_markup>`.

The :restref:`Custom Interpreted Text Roles <directives.html#role>`
which is a reST directive ``role``, the tailor the renderer to
apply some special formatting. We use it
:ref:`in Sphinx section <css_class>`
to use a special css class for some span of text.

- Second item


We can begin each item with ``*``, ``+``, ``-``, ``•``, ``‣``, or
``⁃`` followed by at least one space, you should keep the indentation
of the text of the first line in subsequent lines.

See :restref:`bullet list reference<restructuredtext.html#bullet-lists>`

2. We start with point number 2
#. Automatically numbered item.

a) Point a

   i) first subitem
   ii) second subitem

b) Point b
#) Automatic point c.

We can use enumerate with numerals, alphabetic lower case or upper
case, roman numerals lower case or upper case.

We can write enumeration followed by a period, a right parenthesis, or
surrounded by a parentheses; but these punctuation are not kept in the
rendering; *rst2html* render ``i.``, ``i)`` or ``(i)`` as "i." and
Sphinx render them as "a.".

A list must be separated from previous paragraph by a blank line, in
the same way sublists must be separated from items of upper list by a
blank line.

Any break of sequence in the source, produces a new list.

See :restref:`enumerated list reference
<restructuredtext.html#enumerated-lists>`.

  Definition of "what". We add a few
  words to show the line wrapping.

how
  Definition of "how".

why : cause
  We define "why" we do it.

  In many paragraphs.

With ReST but not Sphinx you can use a classifier after the main term
like
::

   why : cause
     We define "why" we do it.

We may have to escape a markup character to clear ambiguity between
a definition list and an other construct like:

::

   \(w)
      This is a definition list, not an enumeration.

        --delta=len  Same with value
        --option-name-is-long
           description on the next line.


It is nice to align option descriptions, but not mandatory, but at
least two spaces must separate an option from the description.

Blocks
======

.. contents::

.. _literal_block:

Literal Block
-------------

:restref:`rest literal blocks <restructuredtext.html#literal-blocks>`

A block which is not interpreted at all is preceded by a  paragraph
consisting of ``::``   and a blank line. The block must be indented.

The double ``::`` is removed from the output.

To use a specific formatting, you can use the
:ref:`code directive <rst-code>`

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50, 50

   *
      - .. code-block:: ReST


           Block one

           ::

              **No** interpretation of
              |special| characters.


      - Block one

        ::

           **No** interpretation of
           |special| characters.

You can also put the ``::`` at the end of the paragraph preceding the
block. When text immediately precedes the ``::`` the two colons are
displayed as ":", if there is a space before the colons they are
removed from the output.



.. list-table::
   :widths: 50, 50

   *
      - .. code-block:: ReST

           Block in condensed syntax::

             -  I'm not a list.

      - Block in condensed syntax::

          -  I'm not a list.

   *   - .. code-block:: ReST

            Another block! ::

               In the text body,
                  indentation is
               preserved

       - Another block! ::

            In the text body,
               indentation is
            preserved

.. warning::

   *Sphinx* use literal blocks to :ref:`highlight source code
   <code_highlighting>`, so ``**No**`` is still written
   with a  bold font by *Sphinx* while being not interpreted by
   *rst2html*.

   To disable *Pygment* decorations in *Sphinx* use a
   :ref:`code block <code_block>` in ``text`` language.

.. index::
   single: block; line
   single: quotes; line block

Line blocks
-----------

In a line block (:restref:`ref <restructuredtext.html#line-blocks>`)
every line is preceded with ``|`` and at least one space.


.. list-table::

      Nor from both,
      Nor without a cause,
      Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.

      --Nagarjuna - *Mulamadhyamakakarika*

Block quotes (:restref:`ref <restructuredtext.html#block-quotes>`) are
created by just indenting them more than the surrounding paragraphs.

    Neither from itself nor from another,
    Nor from both,
    Nor without a cause,
    Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.

    --Nagarjuna - *Mulamadhyamakakarika*

An optional attribution can be set by a line beginning by two or three
minus signs flushed left at the level of the quote.


.. index::
   pair:directive; pull-quote

.. _pull-quote:

Pull-quote
----------

Pull-quotes  (:restref:`ref <directives.html#pull-quote>`)
are similar to blockquotes but are :ref:`directives <rest_directives>`



.. code-block:: ReST

   .. pull-quote::

      Just as a solid ...

.. pull-quote::

  Just as a solid rock is not shaken by the storm, even so
  the wise are not affected by praise or blame.

.. index::
   single: blockquote; epigraph
   single: blockquote; highlights
   directive; epigraph
   directive; highlights


.. _epigraph:

Epigraph and highlights
-----------------------

An `epigraph` directive (:restref:`ref <directives.html#epigraph>`) and an
`highlights` directive (:restref:`ref <directives.html#highlights>`)
are aimed to put a quotation in a distinct font.

*don't forget the final* **s** *of highlights, or you fall down on the*
:ref:`Sphinx code highlighting directive <code_highlighting>`

.. code-block:: ReST

   .. highlights::

      With these *highlights* ...

.. highlights::

   With these *highlights* we have completed the ReST blocks.

These three directives are similar in
html  rendering to :ref:`blockquote` but with a `class` of ``pull-quote``,
``highlights`` or ``epigraph`` that your css may use *but default css
does not!*

.. index::
   block; container
   pair: directive; container

.. _container:

Container
---------
.. code-block:: ReST

   .. container:: myclass

      There is also a general ...

.. container:: myclass

   There is also a general :restref:`container directive
   <directives.html#container>` whose unique effect is adding some class
   name to the block that your css may use. In html this paragraph
   is enclosed in a

   .. code-block:: html

      <div class="myclass container">  ... </div>

.. index::
   pair: directive; class


.. _class_directive:

Class
-----

.. code-block:: ReST

   .. class:: myclass

   The class directive ....

.. class:: myclass

The class directive (:restref:`ref <directives.html#class>`) add a
class on its content or on the first immediately following non-comment
element.  The name of the class is normalized by docutil to conform to
the regexp: ``[a-z](-?[a-z0-9]+)*``.

.. note::

   While the docutil tool ``rst2html`` put as expected the previous
   paragraph in a::

     <p class="myclass">....</p>

   Sphinx shadows the class directive, so the previous code will not
   have the expected result. In Sphinx you have to replace ``class``
   by ``rst-class``.

      ===========  ================

Simple tables (:restref:`ref <restructuredtext.html#simple-tables>`)
are preceded and ended with a sequence of "``=``" to indicate the
columns, e.g:

==  ==
aA  bB
cC  dD
==  ==

Headers are indicated by another sequence of "``=``", e.g:

=====  ======
Vokal  Umlaut
=====  ======
aA     äÄ
oO     öÖ
=====  ======

Column spans are followed by a sequence of "``-``" (except for the last header
or last row of the table where we must have "``=``"), e.g:

=====  =====  ======
Inputs        Output
------------  ------
  A      B    A or B
=====  =====  ======
False         False
------------  ------

============  ======

Simple table cells are treated like a small document on their own up to line
breaks, but the first column must contain a single line.
e.g:

1. Hallo     | blah blah blah
               blah blah blah
               blah

A list-table (:restref:`ref <directives.html#list-table>`) is a two

list. The number of column must be uniform (*no column span*) but
cell may contain structured markup.

LaTeX table rendering.
----------------------

.. index::
   latex; tabulary

Rendering with *tabulary*.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sphinx use the latex package `tabulary
<http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/tabulary/tabulary.pdf>`_
to render tables in laTeX.

Tabulary is an extension of the *tabular* package which calculate the
width of columns; it has four new formats specifications: ``LRCJ`` for
Left (Right, Centered, Justified) column with automatic width.

Sphinx uses by default ``L``, but you can override it with a directive
like::

    .. tabularcolumns:: |L|C|C|R|

As examples in this document the :ref:`source code directives table
<source_code_directives>` which has a proper Sphinx automatic rendering
in tabulary ``|L|L|``, which adapt the column size with a wider left one.

The two first :ref:`simple tables <simple_table>` the :ref:`csv table
<csv_table>` and the :ref:`list table <list_table>` are also
rendered in `tabulary` with a proper calculation of table width by
latex.

.. index::
   latex; tabular

Rendering with *tabular*.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tables that contain any kind of lists, such as object descriptions,
blockquotes, or literal blocks are set by default with the `tabular
<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables#The_tabular_environment>`_.
In sphinx prior version 1.6 the `:column:` option for list table is not
used for latex, and all  columns are of the same size.

You can tailor the rendering by giving `tabularcolumns` directive
which uses the `p{width}` column type.

Like this for three uneven columns:

.. code-block:: ReST

   .. tabularcolumns::
         |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.30\linewidth}|

.. _cross_reference:

Cross reference.
================

.. contents::
   :local:

.. index::
   hyperlink
   pair: hypertext; link
   pair: hypertext; target
   reference
   ref
   pair: reference; target
   pair: reference; label
   pair: reference; cross
   pair: reference; indirect

Hypertext link.
---------------

Hypertext links are constituted of a reference and a target.


And there are four types of hyperlink targets:

1. An external hyperlink target is an URI or an email addresses like

   .. code-block:: ReST

      _Docutils: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/
      _John Lee: john.lee@gmail.com

   It is possible, but not recommended, to avoid the target reference by using an
   `anonymous hyperlink`_.

2. An :ref:`explicit hyperlink target <explicit_target>` is an internal document
   reference which point to some location in the same document.

3. An `indirect hyperlink`_ has an other hyperlink reference as target.

4. An `implicit hyperlink target`_ is generated by the *docutil* ReST processor, for all
   sections of the document.

There exist three ways to write hyperlink references
(:restref:`ref<restructuredtext.html#hyperlink-references>`)

1. In  `Citation Style`_
2. Inline with an `Embedded URI`_ which gives in the same construct
   both the reference and the target.
3. In a `standalone hyperlink`_ the text of the target URI is used as
   reference.

.. index::
   pair: internal; reference
   pair: option; name



.. _explicit_target:

Explicit hyperlink target
-------------------------

.. _internal:

An :restref:`explicit hyperlink target
<restructuredtext.html#explicit-hyperlink-targets>` is an
*internal document reference* for any text location.

You define it by preceding  the text location with:

.. code-block:: ReST

   .. _label:
   .. _other label:

plus a blank line.

A ``:name:`` option in any block is also an internal reference target.

You can also use :restref:`inline internal targets
<restructuredtext.html#inline-internal-targets>`

::

   which are a _`span of running text` in a paragraph.

.. _rest_ref:

The ReST way of referencing a label or :restref:`hyperlink targets
<restructuredtext.html#hyperlink-targets>` is:

.. code-block:: ReST

   label_ or `other label`_

.. index::
   pair: indirect; hyperlink
   pair: hyperlink; alias

The explicit hyperlink targets need to be unique in the document, and if you use them
with Sphinx to be unique in the set of project documents.

They override any identical implicit target. Oneness of reference is easier to maintain
with explicit rather implicit targets.

.. _indirect hyperlink:

Indirect Hyperlink.
-------------------

If for the same hyperlink target you want to use a you want to use
many references you can use an *indirect hyperlink* or *indirect
reference*. With the following indirect references pocoo_, Sphinx_,
`The manual`_ and Documentation_ refer to the same place.

Like above don't forget backquotes when there are embedded
whitespaces.

.. code-block:: ReST

   .. _pocoo:  http://sphinx.pocoo.org
   .. _Sphinx: pocoo_
   .. _The manual: pocoo_
   .. _Documentation: `The manual`_

.. _Sphinx Home: http://sphinx.pocoo.org
.. _pocoo:  http://sphinx.pocoo.org
.. _Sphinx: pocoo_
.. _The manual: pocoo_
.. _Documentation: `The manual`_

Note that if you only want to have multiple link text with the same
target you can also use:

.. code-block:: ReST

   .. _Sphinx:
   .. _The manual:
   .. _pocoo:  http://sphinx.pocoo.org

Multiple adjacent hyperlink references
will  all point to the same target.

An indirect hyperlink can also be defined inline with  an `embedded alias`_.

.. index::
   pair: hyperlink; anonymous
.. _anonymous hyperlink:

Anonymous Hyperlink
-------------------

:restref:`Anonymous hyperlinks <restructuredtext.html#anonymous-hyperlinks>`
are hyperlinks where the target has no label text but begins with double leading
underscores, the reference itself ends with two trailing underscores.

The targets are found by their sequential order in the document. The reference number
*n*, reference the target number *n*.

Example:

.. code-block:: ReST

   .. __: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html

   The `ReST reference manual`__

.. __: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html

The `ReST reference manual`__

The anonymous hyperlinks make the source text quite obscure, as the association between
reference and targets can only be seen by enumerating both. They break easily. Moving a
bloc of text with either a target or reference invalidate all anonymous hyperlinks of
the document. So it is wise to avoid them.


.. index::
   hyperlink; implicit target
   implicit; hyperlink

.. _implicit hyperlink target:
.. _implicit hyperlink:

Implicit Hyperlink Targets
--------------------------

Section titles, footnotes, and citations automatically are
:restref:`implicit hyperlink targets
<restructuredtext.html#implicit-hyperlink-targets>`.

To give an example in the present document, under the section `Structural elements`_ you
find a subsection named `Transition`_. This section does not have any explicit hyperlink
target, but when you write in the text ```Transition`_`` it produces `Transition`_.

.. _indirect reference to an implicit target:

In pure ReST syntax you can reference the `Transition`_ section as `how to draw an
horizontal line`_ with the hyperlink: ```how to draw an horizontal line`_`` and the
`indirect hyperlink`_:

.. code-block:: ReST

  .. _how to draw an horizontal line: Transition_

.. _how to draw an horizontal line: Transition_

You can also use them with an `embedded alias`_

.. list-table::

   * - .. code-block:: ReST

          | The `Transition section <Transition>`_ shows
          | `how to draw an horizontal line`_
            in your document.

     - | The `Transition section <Transition>`_ shows
       | `how to draw an horizontal line`_ in your document.

Implicit targets are easily broken, rewording a section title, or evenfixing a typo,
changing a punctuation, break all the references. And when modifying a title you don't
always think it might be a link target somewhere in the document.

You don't modify so often the explicit link targets, and when you do it, you know that
you have also to fix all references. So you should put away implicit in favor of
explicit.

.. index::
   reference; citation style

.. _citation style:

Reference in citation style.
----------------------------

.. code-block:: ReST

   A link to `Sphinx Home`_ in citation style.

   .. _Sphinx Home: http://sphinx.pocoo.org


A link to `Sphinx Home`_ in citation style ( :restref:`ref
<restructuredtext.html#hyperlink-targets>`).

In printed documents the link will be listed similar as a citation, as
opposed to HTML documents.

.. _reference name:

The reference target is composed of words made of alphabetic and numeric characters and
characters in the set ``[,:_+-]`` *without double hyphens*, separated by spaces.
(:restref:`ref <restructuredtext.html#reference-names>`).

The references are equivalents when they differ only by case or number of spaces. The
space character class include spaces, horizontal or vertical tabs, newlines, carriage
returns, or form feeds.

When the reference has no embedded spaces the backquotes are not
necessary:

.. code-block:: ReST

   A link to Sphinx_ in citation style.

If you want to use a |styledref|_ you have to use a
ref:`replacement`.

.. |styledref| replace:: *styled* reference
.. _styledref: `styled reference`_

.. index::
   pair: reference; embedded
   pair: reference; in-line
   pair: hyperlink; embedded
   pair: alias; embedded

.. _embedded uri:
.. _embedded alias:

Embedded URI and Aliases
------------------------

Reference: :restref:`ref
<restructuredtext.html#embedded-uris-and-aliases>`

You can directly embed an URI, a link target or an internal label in a reference enclosed in ``<``, ``>``
in the reference.

In the same way than explicit :ref:`indirect hyperlink` when we use a target defined
elsewhere we have use a trailing underscore.

In the last example we use the label ``explicit_target`` placed before a section at the
beginning of this document.

   Sphinx reference; vs ReST

.. _sphinx vs rest references:

Difference between ReST and Sphinx location reference
-----------------------------------------------------

Sphinx has its own *preferred syntax*,
it uses:

.. code-block:: ReST

   :ref:`displayed text <label>`

it is specific to Sphinx and you find it :ref:`in the Sphinx section
<sphinx_cross_references>`.

While ReST internal hyperlinks reference a target in the same document, Sphinx
allow linking across files of the same project.

.. _sphinx vs rest ref rendering:

These two syntax do not have the same rendering, the text of the target label is used by
ReST as default displayed text, while Sphinx syntax either need a reference displayed
text or when the target is preceding a section the name of the section is used as
default displayed text, the text of the label is never used by Sphinx to display the
link.

In this document there is two reference targets before the section *Sidebar and Topic*,
the next table show how they are rendered.

.. list-table::

   * - .. code-block:: ReST

          `Sidebar`_ versus `Topic`_

     -  `Sidebar`_ versus `Topic`_

   * - .. code-block:: ReST

          :ref:`Sidebar` versus :ref:`Topic`

     - :ref:`Sidebar` versus :ref:`Topic`


You cannot use the Sphinx ``:ref:`` syntax to reference
:restref:`implicit hyperlink targets <implicit hyperlink targets>`.
but there is an :ref:`autosectionlabel extension <autosectionlabel>` which provides
a label for each section across the whole project.

When using the Sphinx syntax it is easier to always define an :ref:`explicit target
<explicit_target>`, which is also is more robust as a rewording of a section title will
not invalidate the document.

.. _explicit_markup:

Explicit Markup
===============
They all begin with two periods and a white space.

.. index::
   !footnote

Footnote
--------
ref: :restref:`footnotes <restructuredtext.html#footnotes>`

To define a footnote numbered 2 you write it
``.. [2]`` precedes the definition of the footnote 2.  It is referenced by
``[2]_``. E.g.


.. list-table::
   :widths: 40, 60

   *
      - .. code-block:: ReST

           In the text [2]_.

           .. [2] In the footnote.

      - In the text [2]_.

        .. [2] In the footnote.

      - First automatic [#]_.
        Another automatic [#]_.

        .. [#] The first automatic.
        .. [#] The other automatic.

      - A labeled automatic [#one]_.
        Another of these [#two]_.

        .. [#one] footnote.
        .. [#two] labeled footnotes.

   *  - .. code-block:: ReST

           An autosymbol [*]_.
           More autosymbol [*]_.

        .. [*] other labeled footnote.


*Labeled footnotes are always numerics.*

.. index::
   !citation

Citation
--------

   * - .. code-block:: REST

          We can use also links like Project_

     - | As citation define ordinary target reference
       | We can use also links like Project_


``.. [project]`` is followed by the definition of the citation
It is referenced as ``[project]__``.

Citation labels are **single word** `reference name`_.

In Sphinx, definition and reference can reside in
different files.

Images and LaTeX export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The reST command `rst2latex` use the width an hight of images and
figures but
the Sphinx laTeX exporter use also ``\includegraphics`` to import the figure;
but (as a far as Sphinx 1.2pre) it does not use the width and height
attribute.

To get proper figure size in latex generated by Sphinx you may have either to

   - resize the figure before including it,
   - use the ``:scale:`` option that is supported and generates a latex
     ``\scalebox``
   - or put a distinct laTeX code in an ``raw:: latex`` directive that
     use something like::

       \includegraphics[width=60mm, height=40mm]{myfig.png}

Latex does not support svg and it has to be converted to eps or pdf,
pdf being the only one to support transparency.
The conversion can be done with  Inkscape, it can be automated as
`explained by Johan B. C. Engelen
<http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/svg-inkscape/InkscapePDFLaTeX.pdf>`_.
You can also use the `ipe drawing editor

You must use ``code-block`` or ``sourcecode`` with Sphinx

      - This example is |stupid|

        .. |stupid| replace:: not so clever

.. _styled reference:

One use of replacements is to create styled reference.

If we are not satisfied by a reference like:
`more in ReST directives manual`_ that you get with

.. code-block:: ReST

   .. _ more in ReST directives manual:
        http://docutils.sourceforge.net/doc...

but you want to get: |more-doc|_.

You use the replacement:

.. code-block:: ReST

   ... want to get: |more-doc|_.

   .. |more-doc| replace::  *more in* **reST** *directives manual*
   .. _more-doc: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/doc...

We also use substitutions to include unicode characters like |copy|
with:

.. code-block:: ReST

   .. |copy|   unicode:: U+000A9 .. COPYRIGHT SIGN

If you use Sphinx there are also three :sphinx:`predefined substitutions
<markup/inline.html#substitutions>`:
``|release|``, ``|version|``, ``|today|``.

.. |more-doc| replace::  *more in* **reST** *directives manual*
.. _more in ReST directives manual:

.. index::

.. _file_include:

File include
------------
To include a ReST file use::

.. include:: subdir/incl.rst

You can put the file wherever you want the relative paths are
interpreted relative to the source directory.

The options: ``start-line``, ``end-line``, ``start-after``, ``end-before``
as referenced in :restref:`reST Directives
<directives.html#including-an-external-document-fragment>`.

If you use ``include`` with Sphinx, you should exclude the included
files from the source file lookup, by setting in ``conf.py`` the value
`exclude_patterns <config.html#confval-exclude_patterns>` to a glob
pattern in like::

   exclude_patterns = ["include/**"]

For including source code in Sphinx rather use the Sphinx directive
:ref:`literalinclude <source_code_include>`.

   the body of the topic, and are
   interpreted as *body elements*.

Rubric

A :restref:`rubric
<directives.html#rubric>`
is a title not appearing in the table of contents::

   .. rubric:: ‹Title›

.. _comment:

Comment
-------

Everything starting like a directive with two periods and a space but
not a valid construct is a comment. The comment consume all indented
text following it. To avoid a confusion with an other constructs, you can
let the first line of a block comment empty except the two periods.

When the two dots are not followed by any text, but a blank line, this
is an empty comment, that will not consume a following indented block.
Empty comments are used to terminate a preceding construct.

Common options
--------------
ref: `Directives Common Options
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#common-options>`_

The class options ``:class:`` and ``:name:``
are supported by most of the directives.

In the following :ref:`topic <topic>` and `autre <#topic>`_ the ``:name:`` act as a
reference target. Here we can refer to the following block as `say-no-more`_.

.. code-block:: ReST

   .. topic:: The end
      :class: exceptional
      :name: say-no-more

      A final word.

The ``class`` render in html as:

.. code-block:: html

  <div class="exceptional topic" id="say-no-more">
  <p class="topic-title first">the end</p>
  <p>A final word.</p>
  </div>

.. topic:: the end
   :class: exceptional
   :name: say-no-more

   A final word.
