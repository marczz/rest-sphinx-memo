This Memo aim to be a quick reference to ReST and Sphinx syntax, it tries to give a
short reference to the most usual [*]_ constructs and gives cross-references to the
manuals for details.

Sphinx  is very well documented, but is very large and cover
many aspects, all of them  not for daily use.

The ReST documentation is very rigorous and copious but not of easy access,
as the documentation is scattered in many locations.

Sphinx extend Rest, but introduces incompatibilities with pure ReST constructs.

..  [*] *usual* ranking is done only from what I use!
